# AI Bowling Ball Recommendation System

This Jupyter notebook, `bowling_spec.ipynb`, is part of an innovative project that combines artificial intelligence with the sport of bowling to recommend the most suitable bowling balls based on players' styles and preferences. Using machine learning techniques, this model analyzes player performance data to optimize ball choice, enhancing both player efficiency and satisfaction.

## Overview

The goal of this notebook is to showcase the development and evaluation of a predictive model that assists bowlers in selecting the best bowling ball for their specific needs. The project leverages various machine learning algorithms to predict optimal ball characteristics such as weight, material, and balance.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Cleaning and structuring data collected from players and ball performance metrics.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identifying the most impactful features that influence bowling ball performance.
- **Model Training**: Applying machine learning algorithms to predict the best bowling ball specs.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the accuracy and efficiency of the model with real-world data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for data manipulation and machine learning.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data handling and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations of the data and results.

## Dataset

The dataset includes detailed measurements of player performance and bowling ball characteristics, collected from various bowling centers and professional players. This includes data on ball speed, spin, material type, and player preferences.

## Models Used

- **Linear Regression**: To predict continuous outcomes based on player performance metrics.
- **Random Forest**: For classification of ball types based on categorical outcomes.
- **Neural Networks**: To handle complex relationships and interactions between features.

## Results

The model successfully predicts the optimal bowling ball specifications with a significant degree of accuracy, improving player performance and satisfaction. Further details on model performance metrics such as MSE and accuracy score are included in the notebook.
